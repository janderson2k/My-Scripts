# \# UncleJay2k Scripts Collection

# 

# A personal stash of scripts I’ve built or borrowed to keep my IT head clear and my day flowing smoother. Not a vast library—just stuff I’ve used, tuned, or tinkered with across VMware, Hyper-V, SAN, and automation land.

# 

# ✨ \*\*Some scripts slap. Some are pure vibe. None are guaranteed.\*\*

# 🧨 \*\*Assume danger at all points. Proceed with caution and a test lab nearby.\*\*

# 

# If you find something useful, awesome—fork it, run it, turn it into something better. HAVE AT IT.

# 

# 🧰 Expect PowerShell, Ansible, a little Terraform, and the occasional “What was I thinking?” inline comment.

# 

# Find me on YouTube as \*\*UncleJay2k\*\* for infrastructure thoughts, automation chats, and honest takes from someone who's been doing IT for decades.

# 

# May your scripts run clean and your SANs stay synced.
