# UncleJay2k Scripts Collection
A personal stash of scripts I’ve built, borrowed, or tuned to keep my IT head clear and my day flowing smoother. It’s not a vast library—just tools I’ve used across VMware, Hyper-V, SANs, and automation land.
✨ **Some scripts slap. Some are pure vibe. None are guaranteed.** 
🧨 **Assume danger at all points. Test in a lab before unleashing chaos.**
If you find something useful—fork it, run it, remix it, improve it. Have at it.
🧰 Expect PowerShell, Ansible, a bit of Terraform, and the occasional “What was I thinking?” inline comment.

Infrastructure thoughts, automation rants, and honest takes from decades in the trenches.
May your scripts run clean and your SANs stay synced.
